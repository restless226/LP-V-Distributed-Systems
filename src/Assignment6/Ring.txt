The code you provided implements a simplified version of a ring-based election algorithm. Let's go through the code and explain its functionality in simple words:
1.	The Ring class represents the ring network and contains various methods to manage the processes in the ring.
2.	When the Ring class is instantiated, it takes the number of processes (n) as input and initializes the state of all processes as active. It also sets the last process as the initial coordinator.
3.	The deactivate_process method allows you to deactivate a specific process in the ring. It checks if the process is already inactive and deactivates it if it's active. It keeps track of the count of inactive processes.
4.	The view_ring method displays the active processes in the ring. If all processes are inactive, it displays a message indicating that all members are inactive.
5.	The election method initiates the election process to select a coordinator. It starts with an initiator process and passes a token from process to process in a circular manner. Each process checks if it is active and compares its ID to the current coordinator's ID to determine if it should become the new coordinator. The process with the highest ID becomes the coordinator.
6.	The ping_coordinator method allows a process to send a message to the coordinator. It checks if the process itself is inactive and handles the case when the coordinator is inactive. If the coordinator is active, it displays a message indicating that the message is being sent to the coordinator.
7.	The setCoordinator method allows you to manually set the coordinator ID.
8.	In the main method, the program starts by asking the user to input the number of processes in the ring. Then it enters a menu loop where the user can choose different options:
•	Deactivate a process: Takes a process ID as input and deactivates that process.
•	Ping coordinator: Takes a process ID as input and sends a message to the coordinator.
•	View ring: Displays the active processes in the ring.
•	Election: Initiates the election process with a specified process as the initiator.
•	Exit: Terminates the program.
9.	The program continues to display the menu until the user chooses to exit.
In summary, the code allows you to simulate a ring-based election algorithm. You can deactivate processes, view the active processes, send messages to the coordinator, and initiate the election process. The algorithm ensures that a new coordinator is elected in the ring if the current coordinator becomes inactive.
Then it enters a menu loop where the user can choose different options:

Deactivate a process: Takes a process ID as input and deactivates that process.
Ping coordinator: Takes a process ID as input and sends a message to the coordinator.
View ring: Displays the active processes in the ring.
Election: Initiates the election process with a specified process as the initiator.
Exit: Terminates the program.
The program continues to display the menu until the user chooses to exit.

In summary, the code allows you to simulate a ring-based election algorithm. You can deactivate processes, view the active processes, send messages to the coordinator, and initiate the election process. The algorithm ensures that a new coordinator is elected in the ring if the current coordinator becomes inactive.

The election method is responsible for initiating the election process in the ring network and selecting a new coordinator. Let's break down its functionality step-by-step:
1.	The method starts by checking if all members of the ring are inactive. If all processes are inactive, it prints a message and aborts the election process by setting the coordinator to -1. This ensures that no coordinator is selected when all processes are inactive.
2.	The method takes an input parameter id, which represents the ID of the process initiating the election. It subtracts 1 from the ID to match the index of the process in the process_state array.
3.	It initializes current_coordinator with the id, assuming the initiator is the current coordinator candidate.
4.	The variable token is initialized to (id + 1) % n, representing the next process to receive the election message. The modulo operation ensures that the token wraps around to the first process when it reaches the last process.
5.	The method prints the message indicating the initiator of the election.
6.	The method enters a loop that runs until the token returns to the initiator process (i.e., token == id). This loop represents the actual election algorithm in the ring.
7.	Inside the loop, it prints the message indicating the current token process.
8.	It checks if the process corresponding to the current token is active (process_state[token]). If it is active, it compares its ID (token) with the current coordinator candidate (current_coordinator). If the token process has a higher ID, it updates current_coordinator to the ID of the token process.
9.	The token is updated by incrementing it by 1 and taking the modulo n, ensuring it moves to the next process in a circular manner.
10.	Once the loop completes, the method prints the message indicating the elected coordinator, which is the process with the highest ID among the active processes.
11.	Finally, the method updates the coordinator variable with the ID of the elected coordinator, making it the new coordinator.
In summary, the election method performs the election algorithm in the ring network. It starts with an initiator process and passes a token from process to process, evaluating their IDs to select the process with the highest ID as the new coordinator. The method ensures that even if the current coordinator becomes inactive, a new coordinator is elected among the active processes.
